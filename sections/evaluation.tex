\section{Evaluation}

% discussed about metrics

\subsection{Transcription}

% WER (a standard approach)

\subsection{Finalised Order}

% Sequence independent metric (hit or not)
% metrics for labeling task can be adapted: F-scores, confusion matrix
% ref: "A review on multi-label learning algorithms (ML Zhang, 2013)" Section 2.2

\subsection{Action Flow}

% Match actions over time: e.g. add, remove items
% Sequence dependent metric
% evaluate: can it peoduce the correct sequence of actions?
% evaluate: can it peoduce a good time alignment for each of the actions?
%   metrics for force alignment tasks can be adapted: mean displacement

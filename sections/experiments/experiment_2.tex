\subsection{Audio (Whisper-1): The textual prompt for longer-term dependencies reduces WER}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prompt Engineering Type Tested: One-/Few-shot Prompting.
    \item What are the 'ground truth' values: Human-Validated Transcriptions.
    \item Evaluation Metric: Word Error Rate.
\end{itemize}
Due to the API limitations, which allow only 25 MB or smaller files, the previous longer-term contextual dependencies are lost. 



Prompting with the conversation's previous transcription will hopefully improve the word error rate.

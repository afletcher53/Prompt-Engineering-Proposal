There exists multiple research studies investigating the effects of prompt engineering on LLMs \cite{van_zandvoort_enhancing_2023, lee_cxr-llava_2023, chen_unleashing_2023}. 

\textbf{Definitions: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item One-Shot Learning - The ability of a LLM to learn from a limited dataset, with one example per class \cite{o_mahony_one-shot_2019}.
    \item Few-Shot Learning - The same as one-shot learning but with multiple examples per class \cite{parnami_learning_2022}.
    \item Chain-of-thought reasoning (COTR) is a that parallels human reasoning \cite{wei_chain--thought_2022}. This technique prompts the model to break down the problem into multiple steps before giving a final answer. COTR is a type of few-shot learning.
    \item ROLE PLAY PROMPTING

\end{itemize}
